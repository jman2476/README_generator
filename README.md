  <a id='usage'></a>
  ## Usage
  Once in the directory, open your console and run
```
node index.js
```
and input your information as you are asked. For some prompts, you will just have to enter a single line of text, but when more space is required the program will pull up a text editor for you to put your information into.

When using the text editor, save first and then quit or close the window to move to the next prompt. Which text editor is loaded will depend on your system.

  Try typing some markdown code into one of the text editors, and make sure that the result is the same as you'd expect!
